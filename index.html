				This happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling. About twelve o'clock a troop of ten or
				twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackening its speed, tried to clear
				the way with its cow–catcher; but the mass of animals was too great. The buffaloes marched along with a
				tranquil gait, uttering now and then deafening
				bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction, nothing can
				moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could contain.
			</p>
			<p>
				The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Phileas Fogg, who had the most reason
				of all to be in a hurry, remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it should please the
				buffaloes to get out of the way.
				Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of revolvers upon
				them.

			<p>
				"What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a procession, just as if they were
				not impeding travel! Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his programme! And
				here's an engineer who doesn't dare to run the locomotive into this herd of beasts!"
